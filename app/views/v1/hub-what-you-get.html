      <h2>What you’ll get</h2>
      <p>If you qualify you get:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>£3.10 each week for a pregnancy</li>
        <li>£6.20 each week for children from birth to 1 year old</li>
        <li>£3.10 each week for children between 1 and 4 years old</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="nhsuk-inset-text nhsuk-u-margin-top-5 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-5">
        <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information:</span>
        <p>The money will stop when your child is 4 years old or if you no longer receive benefits.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>When you'll get it</h2>
      <p>The money will be added to your card every 4 weeks.</p>
      <p>You can only spend whatever is on your card. If you try to spend more it will be declined.</p>
      <h3>How long you have to spend it</h3>
      <p>You can only have a maximum of 16 weeks’ money on the card. If you do not spend it in that time your payments will stop. They will start again once you start spending.</p>
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <p>If you get £3.10 every 4 weeks and you do not spend it your payment would stop after 16 weeks.</p>
      <p>£3.10 x 16 weeks = £49.60</p>
      <p>£49.60 would be the maximum amount you can have on the card.</p>
      <p>If you spend all of the £49.60 your payments will start up again as normal.</p>
      <p>If you only spend £2 you would only get a £2 payment. This is because you will have reached your maximum amount again.</p>
      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        Try to spend your money each month and keep your balance low to make sure you get your full amount.
      </div>
      <div class="nhsuk-inset-text nhsuk-u-margin-top-5 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-5">
        <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information:</span>
        <p>Try to spend your money each month and keep your balance low to make sure you get your full amount.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Get free vitamins</h2>
      <p>You can also get free vitamin supplements – tablets for women and drops for children.</p>
      <p>They do not contain milk, egg, gluten, soya or peanut residues. They are suitable for vegetarians and halal diets.</p>
      <p>You can find out more about the vitamins you and your baby need and why at <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/start4life">Start4Life</a>.</p>
      <h3>Children’s vitamin drops</h3>
      <p>These can be taken from birth if your child is having less than 500ml (about one pint) of infant formula a day.</p>
      <p>If they’re having more than this they do not need to take them. This is because vitamins have already been added to formula.</p>
      <p>You or your children should not take more than the recommended amount.</p>
      <h3>Vitamin vouchers</h3>
      <p>Vitamins are not part of the card service yet. You’ll be sent vouchers for them separately if you want them. You can exchange them for vitamins.</p>
      <p>Find out where to exchange your vouchers at:</p>
