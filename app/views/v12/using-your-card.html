      <h2>Using your card</h2>

      <h3>About your card</h3>

      <p>You’ll receive your card by post. It’ll come with your first payment on it and instructions on how to activate and use it.</p>

      <p>You will receive activation instructions with your card. You need to follow these instructions before you use your card.</p>

      <p>Money will be automatically added to the same card every 4 weeks.</p>

      <p>You must keep your card if you’re still getting your benefit.</p>

      <h3 id="activating-and-using-your-card">Before you use your card</h3>

      <p>You need to activate your card before you use your card in a shop.</p>

      <p>To activate your card, <a href="contact-us#card-problems">contact us</a>.</p>

      <p>You’ll need your:</p>

      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>card</li>
        <li>date of birth</li>
        <li>client ID (located at the top of the letter that came with your card)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Find your PIN</h3>

      <p>You need to know your PIN before you use your card in a shop.</p>

      <p>You can find out your PIN when you call to activate your card. To get a reminder of your PIN, <a href="contact-us#card-problems">contact us</a>.</p>

      <p>You’ll need your:</p>

      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>card</li>
        <li>date of birth</li>
        <li>6-digit telephone access code</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you did not give us an email address or a phone number, then you will receive a PIN in the post. Your PIN will be sent out 2 days after your card is sent to you.</p>

      <h3 id="check-your-balance">Checking your balance</h3>

      <p>You can check your balance at any cashpoint. You will need your PIN to check your balance at a cashpoint. You cannot withdraw cash.</p>

      <p>You can also check your balance by <a href="contact-us#card-problems">contacting us</a>.</p>

      <p>You’ll need your:</p>

      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>card</li>
        <li>date of birth</li>
        <li>6-digit telephone access code</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where you can shop</h2>

      <p>You can use your card in most places that sell milk, infant formula, fruit, and vegetables. These include:</p>

      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>bakeries</li>
        <li>corner shops</li>
        <li>food co-ops</li>
        <li>food markets</li>
        <li>greengrocers</li>
        <li>grocery shops (including discount stores)</li>
        <li>hospital grocery shops</li>
        <li>market stalls</li>
        <li>milk floats</li>
        <li>newsagents and newsstands</li>
        <li>petrol stations</li>
        <li>pharmacies</li>
        <li>supermarkets</li>
        <li>sweet shops</li>
      </ul>      

      <p>They must display a Mastercard<sup>&reg;</sup> symbol. The symbol is normally shown on the shop door or at the till. Ask an employee inside the shop if they take Mastercard if you’re unsure.</p>

      <p>If you try to spend the money anywhere else the card will be declined.</p>

      <h3>Shopping with your card</h3>

      <p>You can use your Healthy Start card to buy healthy foods on their own or with other shopping.</p>

      <p>You cannot spend more than the balance of the card.</p>

      <p>If you want to make a contactless payment, the first time you use your card you’ll need to insert your card and use your PIN. After that, you can make contactless payments of up to £45.</p>

      <h4>If you're buying only healthy foods</h4>

      <p>You can pay for them using your Healthy Start card, like you would with a normal contactless bank card. This means you can pay by tapping your card on the card device at checkout. You can also use your card as a chip and PIN card if you prefer. Just put it in the card device and enter your PIN.</p>

      <h4>If you're buying healthy food with other food or drink</h4>

      <p>You can split the payment between your Healthy Start card and your normal bank card or cash. Just tell the cashier you want to do this. You'll also need to tell them how much you want to spend on your Healthy Start card and how much you want to spend on your normal bank card or in cash.</p>

      <h4>If you're buying healthy food at a self-checkout machine</h4>

      <p>You cannot split your payment between your Healthy Start card and another bank card at self-checkout machines. You can only part pay using your Healthy Start card if you're paying the rest in cash.</p>

      <p>Do not worry if you make a mistake when using your Healthy Start card to buy healthy food with other shopping. It will not affect your benefit payments.</p>

      <h4>Refunds</h4>

      <p>If you need to get a refund on something you've bought, you can get the refund in the same way as you would with any bank card. Go back to the shop with your items, your receipt and your card and ask for a refund.</p>

      <h2>Reporting a problem with your card</h2>

      <h3>Problems using your card</h3>

      <p>If you experience any problems using your card, <a href="contact-us#card-problems">contact us</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="card-problems">Lost or stolen cards</h3>

      <p>You’re responsible for all spending on your prepaid card even if someone else uses it.</p>

      <p>You must contact us straight away if:</p>

      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your card is lost or stolen</li>
        <li>your card is being used by someone else without your permission</li>
        <li>you notice a transaction that you do not recognise</li>
      </ul>   

      <p>A lost or stolen card will be immediately blocked so that no one else can use it.</p>

      <p>Any transactions made before the card is reported lost or stolen will be charged to your account.</p>

      <p>To report a card as lost or stolen, <a href="contact-us#card-problems">contact us</a>.</p>

      <p>You’ll need your:</p>

      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>date of birth</li>
        <li>client ID (located at the top of the letter that came with your card)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Turning off contactless payments</h3>

      <p>If you do not want your Healthy Start card to be contactless, <a href="contact-us#card-problems">contact us</a>.</p>

      <p>This will mean that you can only use your card by entering it into the card device and using your PIN.</p>

      <h3>Turning on online payments</h3>

      <p>If you cannot use your Healthy Start card in stores, or are struggling to find healthy food locally, you can call us so we can let you use your card online. To turn on online payments, <a href="#contact" target="_blank">contact us</a>.</p>

      <p>You can request to use your card to pay online if you gave us your mobile number when you applied. If you did not give us your mobile number when you applied, you can <a href="#contact" target="_blank">contact us</a>.</p>

      <p>This will mean that you can use your card to shop online. If you’re shopping online, then you may have to pay delivery charges for your shopping.</p>

      <h4>What to do when paying online </h4>

      <p>When you checkout online, enter your Healthy Start card details like you would with any normal bank card.</p>
      
      <p>After you submit these details, you'll be sent a text that includes a One Time Passcode. Before you can complete your payment, you'll be asked to enter this One Time Passcode.</p>

      <p>If you're just using your Healthy Start card to buy healthy food online, you can use it to buy everything in your basket.</p>
