          <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Designing an 'Apply' service</h2>
          <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Hypothesis A</h3>
          <p style="background: #DEE0E2; padding: 20px;"><strong>We believe</strong> that giving eligible applicants the opportunity to apply online for help to buy milk, food and vitamins <strong>will be a useful feature for</strong> anyone currently
          struggling to feed their children <strong>as it will</strong> enable them with the finanacial support needed to buy healthy foods and milk. <strong>This will</strong> decrease the overall cost of providing the scheme by XX%.</p>
          <p>This prototype is a replica of the last 'Apply' prototype completed by Equal Experts:</p>
          <p><a href="https://htbhf-prototype.herokuapp.com/">https://htbhf-prototype.herokuapp.com/</a><br><strong>Username:</strong> htbhf-user<br><strong>Password:</strong> ?w*keWfh3Sh9</p>
          <p>...however instead of using Gov branding, it uses NHS branding.</p>
          <p>For all design thinking up to this point, EE have put together a <a href="/docs/EE - Apply Journey - Design Rationale.pdf" target="_blank">helpful list of design rationales</a>.</p>

          <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">What we created:</h3>
          <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Used the 'NHS Hub' pattern as the starting point for entering the service. This replicates the potential journey of an applicant entering the service via the NHS website. Idea is to use this content consistantly across all 3 entry points; GOV.uk, NHS.uk and nhsbsa.nhs.uk</li>
            <li>On the Low Income Scheme (another BSA service) we found that 16.4% of adults in England (or 1 in 6 adults) can be described as having ‘very poor literacy skills’. Because of this, users found it extremely helpful when we personalised / tailored the user journey depending on who is applying (main benificiary / third party). So given users of the Low Income Scheme and Healthy Start are from a similar demographic - it makes sense to provide a similar approach here.</li>
